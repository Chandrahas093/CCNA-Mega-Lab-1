# Comprehensice CCNA Enterprise Lab 

## Overview
Successfully designed, built, and managed a complete enterprise network topology from the ground up in the **EVE-NG** simulation environment, validating a wide range of networking skills.

## Key Highlights

### üìâ **Architecture & High Availability**
- Implemented a **redundant spine-leaf** architecture with dual-homed links.
- Configured **dual ISP uplinks** using **OSPF + PAT** for internet redundancy and failover.
- Deployed **HSRP** for first-hop gateway redundancy and load balancing.
- Used **EtherChannel** to increase bandwidth between core and server farm.
- Centralized **DHCP Server** hosted on a Windows Server using **DHCP Relay**.

### üìç **Routing & Switching**
- Created multiple **VLANs** and deployed **VTP** for VLAN consistency.
- Configured **inter-VLAN routing** on **Layer 3 switches**.
- Enabled **Rapid-PVST+** for loop-free topology and better convergence.

### üîê **Security & Access Control**
- Applied **Port Security** on access switches to restrict MAC address flooding.
- Enabled **DHCP Snooping** to prevent rogue DHCP attacks.
- Wrote **ACLs** to control inter-VLAN traffic.
- Configured **SSH** access and restricted it to the **admin VLAN**.

### üìä **Network Management & Monitoring**
- All devices synchronized with **NTP** for consistent timekeeping.
- Configured centralized **Syslog** server to collect logs from all devices.

- Enabled **SNMP** for proactive monitoring.
- Integrated **Zabbix** server to visualize device status and metrics.
